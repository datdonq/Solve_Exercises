The correct answer is A. solute. 

In a solution, a solute is the substance that is dissolved in the solvent. In this case, the salt that is dissolved in the water is the solute. The solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute, which in this case is the water. The solution is the combination of the solute and the solvent. Therefore, when salt is dissolved in water, the salt is referred to as the solute.",,,2024-03-07 15:36:49.323534
